International License Agreement for Non-Warranted Programs

Part 1 - General Terms 

PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE PROGRAM.
Adaptec WILL LICENSE THE PROGRAM TO YOU ONLY IF YOU FIRST ACCEPT THE
TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. BY USING THE PROGRAM YOU AGREE TO THESE
TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT,
PROMPTLY RETURN THE UNUSED PROGRAM TO THE PARTY (EITHER Adaptec OR
ITS RESELLER) FROM WHOM YOU ACQUIRED IT TO RECEIVE A REFUND OF
THE AMOUNT YOU PAID. 

The Program is owned by (Adaptec) or a supplier of Adaptec 
and is copyrighted and licensed, not sold. 

The term "Program" means the original program and all whole or
partial copies of it. A Program consists of machine-readable
instructions, its components, data, audio-visual content (such
as images, text, recordings, or pictures), and related licensed
materials. 

This Agreement includes Part 1 - General Terms and Part 2 
Country unique Terms and is the complete agreement regarding the
use of this Program, and replaces any prior oral or written
communications between you and Adaptec. The terms of Part 2 may
replace or modify those of Part 1. 


1. License 

Use of the Program 

Adaptec grants you a nonexclusive license to use the Program. 

You may 1) use the Program to the extent of authorizations you
have acquired and 2) make and install copies to support the
level of use authorized, providing you reproduce the copyright
notice and any other legends of ownership on each copy, or
partial copy, of the Program. 

If you acquire this Program as a program upgrade, your
authorization to use the Program from which you upgraded is
terminated. 

You will ensure that anyone who uses the Program does so only in
compliance with the terms of this Agreement. 

You may not 1) use, copy, modify, or distribute the Program
except as provided in this Agreement; 2) reverse assemble,
reverse compile, or otherwise translate the Program except as
specifically permitted by law without the possibility of
contractual waiver; or 3) sublicense, rent, or lease the
Program. 

Transfer of Rights and Obligations 

You may transfer all your license rights and obligations under a
Proof of Entitlement for the Program to another party by
transferring the Proof of Entitlement and a copy of this
Agreement and all documentation. The transfer of your license
rights and obligations terminates your authorization to use the
Program under the Proof of Entitlement. 


2. Proof of Entitlement 

The Proof of Entitlement for this Program is evidence of your
authorization to use this Program and of your eligibility for
future upgrade program prices (if announced) and potential
special or promotional opportunities. 


3. Charges and Taxes 

Adaptec defines use for the Program for charging purposes and
specifies it in the Proof of Entitlement. Charges are based on
extent of use authorized. If you wish to increase the extent of
use, notify Adaptec or its reseller and pay any applicable charges.
Adaptec does not give refunds or credits for charges already due or
paid. 

If any authority imposes a duty, tax, levy or fee, excluding
those based on Adaptec's net income, upon the Program supplied by
Adaptec under this agreement, then you agree to pay that amount 
as Adaptec specifies or
supply exemption documentation. 


4. No Warranty 

SUBJECT TO ANY STATUTORY WARRANTIES WHICH CAN NOT BE EXCLUDED,
Adaptec MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE WARRANTY OF NON-INFRINGEMENT
AND THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, REGARDING THE PROGRAM OR TECHNICAL SUPPORT,
IF ANY. Adaptec MAKES NO WARRANTY REGARDING THE CAPABILITY OF THE
PROGRAM TO CORRECTLY PROCESS, PROVIDE AND/OR RECEIVE DATE DATA
WITHIN AND BETWEEN THE 20TH AND 21ST CENTURIES. 

The exclusion also applies to any of Adaptec's subcontractors,
suppliers, or program developers (collectively called
"Suppliers"). 

Manufacturers, suppliers, or publishers of non-Adaptec Programs may
provide their own warranties. 


5. Limitation of Liability 

NEITHER Adaptec NOR ITS SUPPLIERS WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT OR
INDIRECT

DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS, LOST
SAVINGS, OR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR OTHER ECONOMIC
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF Adaptec IS INFORMED OF THEIR
POSSIBILITY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE
EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 


6. General 

Nothing in this Agreement affects any statutory rights of
consumers that cannot be waived or limited by contract. 

Adaptec may terminate your license if you fail to comply with the
terms of this Agreement. If Adaptec does so, you must immediately
destroy the Program and all copies you made of it. 

You agree to comply with applicable export laws and regulations. 

Neither you nor Adaptec will bring a legal action under this
Agreement more than two years after the cause of action arose
unless otherwise provided by local law without the possibility
of contractual waiver or limitation. 

Neither you nor Adaptec is responsible for failure to fulfill any
obligations due to causes beyond its control. 

Adaptec does not provide program services or technical support,
unless Adaptec specifies otherwise.

Agreement; 2) in Albania, Armenia, Belarus, Bosnia/Herzegovina,
